### Why you'll love using Dotenv Vault

---

### Works with a single command

You don't need to install anything to use Dotenv Vault. No error prone binaries to install, infrastructure to maintain, or custom code to write. It just works – with a single command.

```
$ npx dotenv-vault push
```

### Multiple Environments

After you've pushed your .env file, you can manage your secrets across multiple environments. Open an environment to view and edit its environment variables.

```
$ npx dotenv-vault open production
```

### Deploy Everywhere™

Dotenv Vault works everywhere you already deploy your code. Run the build command to generate your encrypted .env.vault file, commit that safely to code, and deploy. There's nothing else like it.

```
$ npx dotenv-vault build
$ git commit -am "Add .env.vault"
$ git push
```
