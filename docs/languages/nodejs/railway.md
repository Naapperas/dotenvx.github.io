## Initial setup

Create an `index.js` file, if you haven't already done so.

##### index.js
```js
// index.js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000
const http = require('http')
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
  res.end(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
})

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port:${PORT}/`)
})
```

Add an empty `package.json`.

##### package.json
```json
{}
```

Commit that to code and deploy it to Railway.

##### CLI
```shell
npx @railway/cli@latest init
npx @railway/cli@latest up
npx @railway/cli@latest domain
```

Once deployed, your app will say `'Hello undefined'` as it doesn't have a way to access the environment variable yet. Let's do that next.

{% include docs/step_build_env_vault.md %}

## Set DOTENV_KEY

Fetch your production `DOTENV_KEY`.

##### CLI
```shell
npx dotenv-vault@latest keys production
# outputs: dotenv://:key_1234@dotenv.org/vault/.env.vault?environment=production
```

Set `DOTENV_KEY` on Railway.

## Deploy

Commit those changes safely to code and deploy.

That's it! On deploy, your `.env.vault` file will be decrypted and its production secrets injected as environment variables â€“ just in time.

You'll know things worked correctly when you see `'Loading env from encrypted .env.vault'` in your logs. If a `DOTENV_KEY` is not set (for example when developing on your local machine) it will fall back to standard [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) functionality.
