title: "Install dotenv-vault via homebrew"
---

Prefer to install dotenv-vault with homebrew, rather than npx? Now you can.

```bash
$ brew install dotenv-org/brew/dotenv-vault
```

Then use the commands directly on your cli:

```bash
dotenv-vault help
```

Visit [/install](/install) for more details.
