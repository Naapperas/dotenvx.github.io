title: "Added better spam protection with Turnstile"
---

We swapped our honeypot spam protection mechanism for [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://blog.cloudflare.com/turnstile-private-captcha-alternative/). It is more reliable at catching spam and the experience is still good â€“ no annoying captchas identifying traffic signs.
