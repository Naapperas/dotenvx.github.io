title: "Added .env.vault decryption support to python dotenv"
---

Decryption support for .env.vault files has been added to Python. If you're using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), or plain ol' Python, you can use Dotenv Vault with it.

Check it out at [python-dotenv-vault](https://github.com/dotenv-org/python-dotenv-vault) and tell your Python friends.
