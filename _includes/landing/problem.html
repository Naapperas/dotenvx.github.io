      <h6 class="fw-bold lh-sm">Manually managing your secrets scatters them everywhere</h6>
      <p class="small">Your developers manage secrets independently, exchanging .env files through insecure channels like email and Slack. Meanwhile, your DevOps team sets secrets through various different platforms and tools, resulting in secrets being spread across multiple locations. Your CSO has no visibility into any of this, leaving them unaware of which secrets are located where, as well as who has accessed them and when.</p>

      <h6 class="fw-bold lh-sm">Alternative solutions have limitations and risks</h6>
      <p class="small">For instance, HashiCorp Vault can lock you into an expensive solution by requiring your team to rewrite code. Similarly, solutions like AWS Secrets and GCP Secret Manager are also pricey and rely on frequent API calls to their services, driving up costs. On the other hand, solutions like Doppler and Infisical avoid the need for code rewrites, but they rely on <a href="https://coderpad.io/blog/development/heroku-github-breach/" class="text-secondary">third-party integrations</a> that may increase your attack surface area, making it more likely for your secrets to leak.</p>
