      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="How does the .env.vault file work?" answer="The .env.vault file is an encrypted version of your .env file. It is paired with a decryption key called the DOTENV_KEY. The DOTENV_KEY is set on your server or cloud hosting provider and the .env.vault file is committed to code." %}
      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="Is it safe to commit the .env.vault file to code?" answer="Yes. AES-256 GCM encryption was developed for the needs of US Government agencies like the CIA. AES-256 takes billions of years to crack using current computing technology. Your secrets are much more likely to be leaked by a third-party. This is why we are so committed to this technology while everyone else is focused on syncing secrets to third-party integrations. We see a better way." %}
      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="How does it protect me from third-party breaches like CircleCI?" answer="In the CircleCI breach the attacker accessed environment variables only. They could not access codebases. To steal your .env.vault secrets, an attacker needs need both â€“ the decryption key AND the encrypted .env.vault file." %}
      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="Is the .env.vault file format a new standard?" answer="Not officially, but our goal is towards that. We're building things in a way that a cloud service is not necessary. As long as you can generate a .env.vault file you can use the technology. It is open to all." %}
      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="What languages are supported?" answer="The .env.vault file and its encryption algorithm is language-agnostic so it works with any language." %}
