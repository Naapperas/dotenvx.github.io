      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="How does encryption work?" answer="A DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY (encryption key) and a DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY (decryption key) are generated using the same public-key cryptography as Bitcoin. The DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY is set on your server or cloud hosting provider and your encrypted .env file is committed safely to code." %}
      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="Is it safe to commit an encrypted .env file to code?" answer="Yes. Secp256k1 asymmetric encryption is used in many cryptographically secure technologies like Bitcoin. It would take on the order of billions of years to crack using current technology - similar to AES-256." %}
      {% include v1/components/faq-question.html question="How does it protect me from third-party breaches like CircleCI?" answer="In the CircleCI breach the attacker accessed environment variables only. They could not access codebases. To steal your encrypted .env secrets, an attacker needs need both â€“ the private decryption key AND the encrypted .env files." %}
