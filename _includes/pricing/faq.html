      <p class="lead fw-normal">We are developers, not sales people or VC-funded founders. We could probably charge more for what we've built but as developers ourselves we don't like the idea of that. We're in this for the long haul â€“Â to build the best darn developer-first secrets manager on the market.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5 h1 fw-extrabold">Non-profit, open-source, and educational discounts</h2>
      <p class="lead fw-normal">Yes, we offer discounts for non-profits, open-source ðŸ’›, and education programs. Contact us at <a href="mailto@support@dotenv.org" class="link-dark">support@dotenv.org</a> after creating your account to get your discount.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5 h1 fw-extrabold">Cancel anytime, no lock-in</h2>
      <p class="lead fw-normal">Cancel your account at anytime. Also, unlike competing solutions, dotenv-vault is designed to work on top of the open .env file format standard. This way you can stop using dotenv-vault and everything will still just work.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5 h1 fw-extrabold">Incrementally grow into dotenv-vault</h2>
      <p class="lead fw-normal">Unlike other secrets managers that are all-or-nothing, you can use dotenv-vault incremently. Start by using it as a way to backup your .env files, grow to using it across your team, and then adopt the encrypted deploys.</p>
